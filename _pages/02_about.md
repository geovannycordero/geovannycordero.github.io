Hey, my name is Geovanny Cordero. I'm a full-stack software developer based in Costa Rica.

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and reading. My favorite movie
is [Fight Club](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/) (1999), and my favorite book
is [1984](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61439040-1984) by George Orwell.

Iâ€™m also passionate about like hiking, walking outdoors, cycling, and hitting the gym.

### Education

I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Costa Rica ([UCR](https://www.ucr.ac.cr/)). I am pursuing
a Master of Business Administration at the Universidad Estatal a Distancia ([UNED](https://www.uned.ac.cr/)).

### Professional Experience

<!-- TODO: add my CV -->

I have been working at Pernix since 2020 as a full-stack developer, where I've taken on various roles, including
programmer, tech lead, and project manager. Since 2022, I've also been involved in the apprentice program, focusing on
the onboarding process and mentoring apprentices throughout their journey in the program.

I have professional experience with the following frameworks and technologies:

- Golang
- Ruby on Rails
- Python
- VueJS
- ReactJS
- TypeScript, JavaScript
- GraphQL

I'm proficient in `Git` and have experience using web-based platforms that provide version control and collaboration
features like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

I also have experience with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) platforms such
as [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

In terms of cloud platforms, I have experience with AWS services, particularly EC2, S3, ECR, ECS, Route 53, VPCs,
Security Groups, and Load Balancers, among others. I have built and maintained the entire infrastructure using AWS,
including setting up CI/CD pipelines and all the deployment processes.
