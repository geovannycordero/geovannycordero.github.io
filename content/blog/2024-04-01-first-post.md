Welcome to my page! This is my first post on my personal website. My idea is to create posts about technology topics and interesting things that I encounter in my journey as a Full-Stack Software Engineer.

## What You Can Expect

I plan to share content about:

### **Technical Topics**
- Software development best practices
- Programming languages and frameworks (especially Golang, Ruby on Rails, and JavaScript)
- System architecture and design patterns
- DevOps and cloud technologies

### **Leadership and Management**
- Team leadership experiences
- Remote work strategies
- Mentoring and career development
- Project management insights

### **Learning and Growth**
- New technologies I'm exploring
- Lessons learned from projects
- Industry trends and observations
- Personal development journey

## My Background

I'm a passionate Full-Stack Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience, currently working at Pernix Solutions. I specialize in:

- **Backend Development**: Golang, Ruby on Rails, Node.js
- **Frontend Technologies**: Vue.js, React, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, Docker, CI/CD pipelines
- **Team Leadership**: Managing international development teams

I'm also currently pursuing an MBA with a focus on Project Management, which adds an interesting business perspective to my technical insights.

## Previous Writing

I have written some posts on Medium before, which you can read on my [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@geovanny_cordero). I'll be migrating some of that content here and expanding on topics that I find particularly interesting or relevant.

## Why This Blog?

Creating this personal blog allows me to:

1. **Share Knowledge**: Document solutions and insights that might help other developers
2. **Build Community**: Connect with fellow developers and tech enthusiasts
3. **Personal Growth**: Reflect on my experiences and learnings
4. **Professional Development**: Establish thought leadership in areas I'm passionate about

## What's Coming Next

In upcoming posts, you can expect to see:

- Deep dives into dynamic programming concepts
- Practical guides for AWS database migrations
- Development environment setup tutorials
- Code kata recommendations and practice strategies
- Leadership lessons from managing remote teams

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow developers, tech enthusiasts, and anyone interested in software engineering and technology leadership.
