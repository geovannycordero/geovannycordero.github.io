I read a lot of articles, posts, and books on the internet about how to improve my life and be a better person. I found
an article listing these canons of conduct written by Thomas Jefferson. I found some of them interesting so I saved the
link to check it out later.

Thomas Jefferson's dozen Canons of conduct in life:

1. Never put off to tomorrow what you can do to-day.

2. Never trouble another with what you can do yourself.

3. Never spend your money before you have it.

4. Never buy a thing you do not want, because it is cheap, it will be dear to you.

5. Take care of your cents: Dollars will take care of themselves!

6. Pride costs us more than hunger, thirst and cold.

7. We never repent of having eat[en] too little.

8. Nothing is troublesome that one does willingly.

9. How much pain have cost us the evils which have never happened.

10. Take things always by their smooth handle.

11. Think as you please, & so let others, & you will have no disputes.

12. When angry, count 10. before you speak; if very angry, 100.

I found of them are useful and other can be adapted to different situations. For example, number two can be discussed
and adapted to a context where delegate things can be more efficient. So check them and see which ones you can apply to
your life.
