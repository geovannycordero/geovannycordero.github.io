    <h2>First Post</h2>
<p>30 Mar 2020</p>
<p>This is my first post in my own page. My idea is keep posting about tech topics and some others that can be interesting for me.</p>

<p>I have previous posts, but they was in Medium, you can check them in my <a href="https://medium.com/@geovanny_cordero" target="_blank">profile</a>. I am also going to post about other things I do, like my <a href="/project.html">projects</a>, <a href="/officialpage/todo.html">books</a> that I read and other topics in the future.</p>
