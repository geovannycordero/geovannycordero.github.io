Some years ago while I was being mentored by a coworker with more experience, he suggested I start doing code katas to improve my coding skills. That was the first time I heard that term, so I asked and researched a little bit about it.

The first page you will find isÂ http://codekata.com/, where you can check the definition of code katas and some examples to practice. Code katas are exercises about programming that help programmers improve their programming skills through practice and repetition. Usually, they are short and repeatable problems designed to challenge and teach different aspects of a programming language, or problem-solving strategies.

I have been using some platforms to practice code katas since then, and here is a list of them so you can start practicing:

- CodeKata:Â http://codekata.com/
- They provide a list of problems and you decide how to solve and test it.
- Codewars:Â [https://www.codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/), check my profileÂ [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/geovannycordero).
- Brings you a list of languages and levels so you can practice accordingly. It provides tests and you can run your program on the platform. You can search for problems randomly.
- LeetCode:Â https://leetcode.com/
- You can find study plans, this platform is more related to interview questions but it would help you improve your coding skills

There are a lot of other examples such as LeetCode, for example,Â [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)Â andÂ [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/). Check them and compare which one is more useful for what you are looking to improve.
