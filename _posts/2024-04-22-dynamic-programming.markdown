Dynamic programming is a method used in computer science and mathematics to solve complex problems by breaking them down
into smaller, individualized sub problems. It’s not an algorithm but a way of thinking.

An example of dynamic programming is the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each
number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence goes like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3,
5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

For example: To find the 5th number in the sequence, you can calculate the sum of the 3rd and 4th numbers. To find the
4th number, you can calculate the sum of the 2nd and 3rd numbers, and so on.
